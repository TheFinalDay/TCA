List of things to redesign/fix: 

F1. The Current Match button needs to be redesigned to make it more obviously clickable and intuitive
F2. Bottom navigational menu in player profile to navigate the pages instead of the dots
F3. Pending sets drag & drop functionality has to  be redesigned for when there is many pending sets to assign.
	> scrollable pending set xone
	> scrollbar in pending set zone
	> tapping empty slot brings up scrollable list of pending sets to chose from
	> auto-assign te each station separately
	> highlighting pending set zone when tapping empty slot
F4. Login page is confusing, needs a redesing, terminology needs to be clear
F5. Most pages should include "Back" button
F6. Score confirmation should take into account the current round and adapt the available score options accordingly (BO3 vs BO5 ...)
F7. Redesign the check in process (already done kinda...)


List of design aspects to possibly consider adding:

S1. The bracket view should be accessible through the side-menu
S2. The bracket view should be accessible through the tourney profile page
S3. The bracket view should be visually similar to the smash.gg/challonge format

S4. The tourney history should be accessible through slide-in menu (possibly replace the recent tourneys)
S5. Remove the Recent Tourneys tiles in the slide-in menu, not a useful feature.
S6. Add links to previous tourney profiles (assuming the pages still exist whithin the client site) in tourney history 

S7. Use highly saturated colors for clickable components and pastel low saturated colors for unclickable components
S8. App should have a default dark theme

S9. In TO version, have Manage Ressources accessible from slide-in menu
S10. Station lists in tourney profile should have interactability (like showing status)
S11. Search bars should be present on every list
S12. Edit player profile button should be made more obvious
S13. Add cancel check-in button when trying to check-in
